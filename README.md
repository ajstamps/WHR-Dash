# WHR-Dash

This is the code that produced the display for the WHR 17.5 to 19 dashboard for the 2018 to 2019 FSAE Seasons. It runs on a Raspberry Pi with a SK Pang CAN Hat. The code is restricted to work on a desktop now, however with some simple changes it can be used for your application if you want. 

This is for use with a Haltech Elite 1500 ECU, though it may work with others in the same family (depends on the CAN protocol they use). Changes are pretty simple to make, and you can add your own flair if necessary. This is only a simple design and could be useful as a starting point if you're looking to start making your own dash. 

Below is what it looks like when functioning (using dummy data)
